I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate at University of Texas Austin at the  [Theory](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/act) group in the department of Computer Science, where I am advised by [Shuchi Chawla](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shuchi/). 
Before UT Austin, I received my M.Sc. in Computer Science from [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) and B.Sc. in Computer Engineering and a minor in Mathematics from [Sharif University of Technology](http://www.en.sharif.edu/).
In Fall 2022, I interned at Google Research, hosted by Gagan Aggarwal and Kshipra Bhawalkar.

**News**: I am curently on the job market!

My research is on algorithmic game theory and mechanism design. I particularly work on multi-dimensional mechanism design and the paradigm of simple vs. optimal, as well as resource and ad allocation under fairness constraints.
